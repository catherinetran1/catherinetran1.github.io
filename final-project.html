                <p class = "findings">The importance of user interviews is to figure out key features and ideas that may help improve the functionality and usefulness of the website. User interviews also help designers learn more about users on a more personal level and see what things users like and dislike. I interviewed people in the industry as well as students in Informatics.</p>

                    Competitor analysis is used by designers to get a better understanding about what other competitors with similar products are doing. I analyzed people in the industry as well as students in the class with similar career goals.

                <p class = "findings">A feature value matrix is used to determine which features on your website are valuable based on numerical values determined by business and user values as well as technical difficulty.  I selected these features that I did because I looked at several UX designers websites and then all had similar features. The differences between them were how they chose to implement those features.

                    User stories are important because they help you figure out the reasons why a specific user will use your website and it will help you determine what features you need to add to make their experience worthwhile. For my user stories, I made the main user a recruiter. I chose a recruiter as my main user because I am using the website as a way to showcase my skills and projects to potential employers.

                <p class = "findings">
                    A cognitive walkthrough is when one or more evaluators walk through a series of tasks and ask a set of questions from the perspective of the user. It helps improve the functionality of the website and can point out mistakes that may have not been caught during the design and implementation phase. Since my website was very simple, it was hard to find 10 tasks that could be done during the walkthrough. However, I found that observing my users and getting feedback and suggestions from them about my website helped me think about what things I need to change about the website.

                <p class = "findings">
                    I chose the click test and the question test because I thought that since they are quick to complete, more people would be willing to take the tests. I think the hardest part about user testing is finding people who would be willing to take time out of their day to take a test. When I sent the tests out to potential users, I would tell them it would take less than a minute just to make sure they know that it won’t take long to complete.

            <h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
             <div class= "textbox">
            <p class="findings">When conducting user research, I found that user interviews and competitor analysis were the most helpful. During a user interview, one person said that they would not add personal social media accounts such as Facebook to their website because they wanted to keep it professional. They would treat their portfolio/website like a resume and only provide relevant information and contacts to their website. Another user stated that she would create a website/portfolio that was interactive to grab people’s attention and keep them on her website. Not only did a get information about features people would add to their website/portfolio, but I also learned a little bit more about them and their aspirations. Some challenges that I faced were finding participants for user interviews that were not students and figuring out how to prioritize my features since I found most of them to be quite important and essential. 

            <br><br>When conducting user testing, I found the cognitive walkthroughs to be the most helpful. It allowed me to see users interact with my website and talk to them about suggestions they have for me in real time. One user suggested that I make the buttons of my contact links smaller and change the color of them as well. User stories were a little difficult for me at first just because I didn’t fully understand it at first. I found that my website was so simple and I couldn’t find a lot of good, useful user stories to tell. I found the usabilityhub.com tests to be really interesting. I liked that it offered different ways to visualize sets of data. My tasks were super simple and some users, after they finished the click test, asked me “Is that it?” They thought they accidently clicked something and that they didn’t finish the test.<br><br>

            My favorite methods that were used to conduct user research and user testing were definitely user interviews and cognitive walkthroughs. I liked getting feedback from actual users. I think bouncing ideas off other people and talking to them about what they would like to see on their websites helped me think about what I wanted to change with mine. </p><br></div>
            
            <h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
             <div class= "textbox">
            <p class = "findings">
            Based on my the user interviews that I conducted, I plan to make a few changes that will hopefully enhance my website. I plan to make my website more interactive to keep users interested and I also want to find a better way to showcase my skills. I have already taken the idea from one of my users to remove my instagram account from my website to keep it more professional. I am still not sure whether or not I will add it back, but as for right now, it will stay hidden. Doing the competitor analysis gave me lots of ideas of what changes I could make to my website. I plan to re-do my project page and make it more interactive and aesthetically pleasing. I saw a couple competitors put clickable snapshots of their projects and once clicked, it would either send the user to a new page or open up a modal that gives a short description about the project, and I would like to try to do a version of that on my website. <br><br>


            From the cognitive walkthrough portion of my testing, I got suggestions from users that I plan to or have already been changed. One user suggested that I make the buttons on my contact me page smaller and change the color of it. I have already made the buttons smaller, but I am still trying to figure out the best color to use for the buttons. Also, when I was doing my user stories, I found that there wasn’t a place where a recruiter could find my skills easily. I plan to create a section on my website that lists the skills that I do have in a way that is more visible to the users. </p></div>
