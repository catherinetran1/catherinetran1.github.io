Our team had an interest in the online world because more and more people are using it to connect with others. Little research has been done on how people build communities on live streaming websites, more specifically, communities on Twitch.<br><br> To understand how streamers build communities on Twitch, we had to conduct observations on Twitch to understand how the platform operates and what type of information is shared. Additionally, we had to interview streamers and viewers to get first person accounts of their experiences using the popular live streaming website. During our data collection process, we were able to identify four themes or growth strategies that aid in the development of a streamerâ€™s community. <br><br>
