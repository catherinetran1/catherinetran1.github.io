                I am currently a senior at the University of California, Irvine pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in <a href="http://www.informatics.uci.edu/undergrad/bs-informatics/" target="_blank">Informatics</a> with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I am in the process of learning the ins and outs of Sketch and Illustrator. I am also trying to improve my HTML and CSS skills and one way I am doing that is by creating this website from scratch! Upon graduating in June 2017, I hope to work for a company that values product and interface design as well as social responsibility.

                If I am not on my computer, you can find me testing out new cooking and baking recipes, eating those recipes I tested out, taking amateur photographs, hanging out with friends and family, or sleeping. I love sleeping.
