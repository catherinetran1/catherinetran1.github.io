                   User Interviews
                </h3>
                <p class = "findings">The importance of user interviews is to figure out key features and ideas that may help improve the functionality and usefulness of the website. User interviews also help designers learn more about users on a more personal level and see what things users like and dislike. When conducting my user interviews, some of the insights that my interviewees gave me were helpful and it made me think about what I could change about my website including what social media accounts to include and features that would make my website stand out. </p>

                   Competitior Analysis
                </h3>
                <p class = "findings">
                    Competitor analysis is used by designers to get a better understanding about what other competitors with similar products are doing. I analyzed people in the industry as well as students in the class with similar career goals. I analyzed people that were current UX designers because that is a career path I am interested in pursuing and I thought that looking a several different UX Designer websites would help me get some new ideas about how to showcase my strengths. I analyzed a student website because she is in the same boat as me and I wanted to see how her website was different from mine.

                   Feature Value Matrix
                </h3>
                <p class = "findings">A feature value matrix is used to determine which features on your website are valuable based on numerical values determined by business and user values as well as technical difficulty.  I selected these features that I did because I looked a several UX designers websites and then all had similar features. The differences between them were how they chose to implement those features.

                   Feature Prioritization 
                </h3>
                <p class = "findings">I prioritized the features based on the overall scores they received when doing the feature value matrix. When making changes to my website, I will focus more on the features that are higher priority and that I find will enhance my website overall.
